### What is MWA?
 * A set of best and modern practices for building Java Web Applications using Maven 3, Servlet 3.0 and Spring 3.1+.
 * It applies sensible defaults for Spring 3.1+ MVC applications.
 * You don't have to learn anything specific about MWA.
 * It reduces startup and configuration time of new applications.
 * Organize your project and code by promoting the use of Modules.

### What is NOT MWA?
